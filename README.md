# Race of Random Simulation

## Project Description
This project implements a racing simulation where N cars navigate through a network of checkpoints using Graph algorithms.

It demonstrates the practical application of data structures (Graph, Heap, Stack, Queue) implemented **from scratch** without using built-in Java collections.

## Technical Details
* **Language:** Java
* **Data Structures:** Graph (Adjacency List), MaxHeap, MinHeap, Stack, Queue, LinkedList.
* **Key Feature:** Custom implementation of all structures to manage race logic (FIFO, LIFO, Priority rules).

## How to Run
1. Open terminal in the project directory.
2. Compile the source files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
